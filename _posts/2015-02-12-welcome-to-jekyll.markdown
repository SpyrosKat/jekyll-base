`What is your favorite thing about providing technical support?`
I love being able to help customers with something that they can't figure out, it makes me feel valuable. I've been involved with IT work since I was a child and using my skills to provide technical support is a great feeling. I also really enjoy the customer service aspect and the opportunity to make a customer feel understood and comfortable.

`What did you think of our service during the time you used it?`
I think your service has a very smooth interface and is fun to use. Figuring out how to use your service was very easy and simple.

`Tell about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.  Briefly explain a challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it.`
Honestly I've learned a lot setting up this site, this has been a valuable experience for me because I had literally never heard of Netlify, GitHub, Pull Requests, etc. before starting this exercise. I made this site by carefully reading directions and being observant. I believe the only tools I used are the Netlify App, GitHub, and Jekyll from StaticGen. I chose Jekyll because I am doing something new, and Jekyll had the most successful users with the fewest reported bugs, along with a description claiming that it was "simple". That seemed like a safe and smart way to proceed. I suppose the main challenge I experienced in setting up this site was that I am unfamiliar with GitHub, I didn't know where to start or how to use it in setting up a website. I solved the problem by carefully following GitHub's "hello-world" tutorial, and now I feel relatively comfortable using GitHub!

`Could you give us a suggestion to improve this test or the job posting?`
I liked the job posting, it was clear, easy to understand, and easy to apply. I am really enjoying this test so far, as it has given me an opportunity to learn a lot. My only suggestion would be to provide more details, or links to tutorials, on how to use Netlify and setup a site. However, I could understand that figuring it out may be part of the test. :)

`Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, that you think are well done, and briefly explain why you think they are well done.`

`Why do you think SSL/HTTPS is important?`
SSL is important because in the modern world, people need secure connections to protect their personal information and interests.

`Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think 2 major challenges around DNS configuration are for less-technical internet end-users:`

`A customer writes in saying their “site won’t build”.  Compose your best short (2-paragraph) customer-facing answer without any additional data, that could be useful in the generic case but would also lead to a customer providing a more actionable response.`

`(optional/bonus) Can you set up a redirect from “/netlify/anything” to https://www.google.com/search?q=anything ?`
